# Nabeel_NLP_Projects
This is repository where I am storing different NLP related projects that are build using Python &amp; Tensor flow

**1) Project: LSTM_Text_Generation_End_To_End_Using_Tensorflow.ipynb**

This is an end to end pipe line for training an LSTM model using Tensorflow and it various functions.

Entire setup is done in Google Colab environment.

I have provided two data sets to experiment with and also two different LSTM models to train. 

You can find various codes on Tensorflow and also on Github that perform same task , however unique thing about my code is that 
in my quest to create an end to end piple line that only uses Tensorflow I have kept my code neat and clean using only Tensorflow.utils, Tensorflow.data.

No where I have done any data conversion to numpy (except when producing output). Plus I have given a function to generate text also. 

This is kind of production level code that you would not necessary find elsewhere.

**2) Project: Voice to text using Tensorflow**

There are three versions of this project which are mainly 3 different types of spectrographs Mel, MFCC and simple. 

I have done data analysis using pandas. However entire data and prediction pipe line is build using pure Tensorflow code specifically Tensorflow.Data. 

I have provided link to data repository on Kaggle. 

Entire setup is done in Google Colab environment. 

I am thankful to Valerio Velardo , whose cousre " Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning" has enabled me to understand this area. Link to youtube course https://youtu.be/iCwMQJnKk2c?si=-8qpwELUi9IVw3yM
