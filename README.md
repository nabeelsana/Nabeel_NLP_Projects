# Nabeel_NLP_Projects
This is repository where I am storing different NLP related projects that are build using Python &amp; Tensor flow

Project: LSTM_Text_Generation_End_To_End_Using_Tensorflow.ipynb

This is an end to end pipe line for training an LSTM model usinhg Tensorflow and it various functions.
I have provided two data sets to experiment with and also two different LSTM models to train. 
You can find various codes on Tensorflow and also on Github that perform same task , however unique thing about my code is that 
in my quest to create an end to end piple line that only uses Tensorflow I have kept my code neat and clean using only Tensorflow.utils, Tensorflow.data.
No where I have done any data conversion to numpy (except when producing output). Plus I have given a function to generate text also. 
This is kind of production level code that you would not necessary find elsewhere.
